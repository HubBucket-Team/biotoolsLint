# What is biotoolsLint?
**biotoolsLint** is a utility (under design!) for verification and reporting of content of the [ELIXIR Tools & Data Services Registry](https://bio.tools).  It will verify the content according to the bio.tools [Curators Guide](https://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html), Tool Information Standard(https://bio-tools.github.io/Tool-Information-Standard/) and other checks, and produce reports for puposes of content quality control and labelling.
